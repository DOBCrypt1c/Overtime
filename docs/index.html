                    Steam is a video game digital distribution service and storefront by Valve. It was launched as a standalone software client in September 2003 as a way for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, and expanded to distributing and selling third-party game publishers' titles. Steam offers various features, like digital rights management (DRM), server hosting and anti-cheat measures, video streaming, and social networking services. It also provides the user with automatic game updating, and community features such as friends lists and groups, community market, cloud storage, and in-game voice and chat functionality.
                    The software provides a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's functions into their products, including in-game achievements, microtransactions, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop. Initially developed for Microsoft Windows operating systems, versions for macOS and Linux were later released. Mobile apps to access online Steam features were released for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone in the 2010s. The platform also offers a selection of digital content, including productivity software, hardware, game soundtracks, anime, and films.
